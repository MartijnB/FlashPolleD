FlashPolleD 0.1

Copyright 2011 iCept Media. All rights reserved.

FlashPolleD is a (very) high performance Flash policy server written in D. A lot 
existing solutions have serious issues when they are stressed. They start to 
crash or leak memory. FlashPolleD is benchmarked with >20.000 reqs/sec on a VPS.
It's tested with IPv4 & IPv6.

== Requirements ==

- Linux 2.6+
- Libev 4

== Installation ==

This is a source only distribution. Buildscripts for gdc are included but every 
D2 compiler with the Phobos runtine should work. The Phobos runtime is staticly 
linked so it isn't a runtime dependency. (But the resulting executable is a bit
bigger.) A default policy file that opens all ports is included.

== Usage ==

Usage: ./server [-46bdfhpv]

  -4, --v4. --ipv4              Use IPv4 sockets [default]
  -6, --v6. --ipv6              Use IPv6 sockets
  -b, --bind=HOST               Bind the socket to HOST
  -d, --daemon                  Daemonize the server
  -f. --policyfile=PATH         Policyfile to serve
  -h, --help                    Help
  -p, --port=PORT               Listen on PORT
  -s, --stats                   Show stats
  -v, --verbose                 Show more debuginformation
